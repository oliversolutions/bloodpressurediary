# bloodpressurediary

Native Android app developed with Kotlin. It allows you to record your blood pressure and observe it’s evolution over time.

Throughout the development of this application we have worked with complex RecyclerViews with different types of View Types, diagrams to represent data in an attractive way for the user, different types of configurable notifications, backups, etc.

Furthermore, it has been developed using the MVVM architecture. If you want to take a look at the app, don’t hesitate to download it:
